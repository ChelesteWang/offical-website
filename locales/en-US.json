In order to help make unintuitive and invisible algorithms intuitive and understandable, we have developed visualization tools for indoor crowds and indoor maps. We use the Guangzhou Airport as the base, apply particle swarm and neural network-based model simulations to it, predict the flow of people in various locations, and take rest, security, and boarding into account; and use this to assess the risk of crowd trampling. And the risk and loss of infection."
